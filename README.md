## âœ¨ Code-base structure

The project is coded using a simple and intuitive structure presented below:

```bash

## How to start the app in Docker

> **Step 1** - Download the code from the GH repository (using 'GIT')

```bash
$ # Get the code
$ git clone https://github.com/Moltrosaurus/MA-Django-Template.git 
$ cd ?
```

<br />

> **Step 2** - Edit `.env` and remove or comment all `DB_*` settings (`DB_ENGINE=...`). This will activate the `SQLite` persistance. 
```txt
DEBUG=True
# Deployment SERVER address
SERVER=.appseed.us
# For MySql Persistence
# DB_ENGINE=mysql            <-- REMOVE or comment for Docker
# DB_NAME=appseed_db         <-- REMOVE or comment for Docker  
# DB_HOST=localhost          <-- REMOVE or comment for Docker 
# DB_PORT=3306               <-- REMOVE or comment for Docker
# DB_USERNAME=appseed_db_usr <-- REMOVE or comment for Docker
# DB_PASS=<STRONG_PASS>      <-- REMOVE or comment for Docker
```

<br />

> **Step 3** - Start the APP in Docker

```bash
$ docker-compose up --build 
```

Visit `http://localhost:5085` in your browser. The app should be up & running.
